# Models for Transformation
* Euclidean - preserve everything
* Similarity - no longer preserves the size
* Affine Transform - skew, parallel lines are still parallel lines
* Homography - coliniarity, projection, moving from 2D space to 3D space. Lines are still lines

## Transformations
* Degrees of freedom for similarity transformation = 4
* Euclidean = 3
