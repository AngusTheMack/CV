# Modelling Complex Data Densities
To build generative models we simply used class-conditional probability distributions:
$$
P(x|w = k)
$$
Over the observed data $x$ for each value of the data $w$. 

This chapter focuses on how to construct complex probability density functions from elementary ones using *hidden variables*.
